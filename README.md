# Maths_Game4Kids

## Project Under Construction

### Technology Notes
- howler.js library is used for audio feedback (win/fail/game over).

## Overview
An educational arithmetic practice game that progressively increases difficulty:
1. Double-digit addition
2. Double-digit subtraction
3. Double-digit subtraction with borrowing (advanced)
4. Triple-digit addition
5. Triple-digit subtraction (advanced)
6. Higher mixed levels (future: multiplication, division)

## Assignment Context (Reference)
Your first assignment starts with building a browser-based game. Thanks to the amount of logic required, games are a great way to learn problem‑solving and program design. You will work individually. Ensure work is your own; small utility snippets from sources like StackOverflow are acceptable if cited.

## Technical Requirements (Checklist)
```
☐ Render a game in the browser.
☐ Implement win/loss (or progress) logic and show messages in HTML.
☐ Separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.
☐ Consistent indentation and whitespace.
☐ Remove dead/commented-out code before production release.
☐ Sensible naming (functions = verbs, data = nouns).
☐ Consistent coding style (e.g., function declarations vs expressions).
☐ Deploy via GitHub Pages for public play.
```

## Roadmap / TODO
- [ ] Normalize score thresholds (current late-level ranges need refinement)
- [ ] Extract remaining legacy generator functions or remove duplicates
- [ ] Add multiplication & division progression tiers
- [ ] Add high score persistence (localStorage)
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (focus states, ARIA live regions)
- [ ] Mobile layout polish / responsive enhancements

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (or use a simple static server). Click Start, answer the displayed problem, and progress through levels as your score increases.
